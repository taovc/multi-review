The methodology you produce will later be used as the criteria by a review agent that is **read-only, runs in an isolated worktree, never performs a git write, and only reviews without modifying**. Therefore:
- ✅ Only write "what to review and how to judge it": check items, severity judgements, architecture/convention concerns specific to this project.
- ❌ Never write any "operating procedure": no commit/push/any git write operation, no "create/skip a worktree", no "fix the bug / patch it along the way", no "post a comment / merge". Those are controlled centrally by the PR Cockpit engine; writing them into the skill only gets them ignored and blocked, and pollutes the methodology.`

**First investigate the repo fully and deeply** (the current directory is the project root); do not just skim:
- Read through every doc: README, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, docs/, memory-vault/, etc.
- Read package.json / the directory layout to work out the tech stack and layering; go into subdirectories to read the real code when needed
- grep out the key conventions: state management, permission model, API/tRPC layer, database/ORM, build-time branching (#if etc.), testing conventions, file organisation rules
- For conventions you are unsure about, read several real files to confirm instead of guessing

Investigate thoroughly (better to read and grep too much), think it through before writing. Then produce a **review methodology targeted at this project**:
- Write the entire methodology in ${langName(opts.lang)} — every heading, paragraph and checklist item in that language; keep proper nouns and code identifiers verbatim
- Cover: cross-cutting impact checks, dedicated checks for this project's own architecture/conventions (based on what you actually found — do not apply unrelated tech stacks), security/permissions, testing, risk points
- Concrete and actionable, referencing real directory/file/identifier conventions
- No vague generalities
${userInstruction ? '- Make sure the special requirements from the reviewer above are reflected' : ''}

Only read-only operations (read files, grep, ls). ❌ Do not perform any write operation.
