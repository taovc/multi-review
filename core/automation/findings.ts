// Single definition of an "outstanding finding": severity is High/Medium (we don't chase Low/nit) and it is not yet resolved.
// Resolved = we retracted it, or the author fixed/replied to it — decided by isRecheckResolved, which reads both axes.
// Everything else counts as still to fix: kept (we stand by it), adjusted (reworded, still valid), discuss, new,
// unaddressed and partial. Reading the resolved side rather than the unresolved side means a status added later is
// treated as unresolved by default, so a High is never dropped and convergence is never falsely reported.
// Auto-fix's "should we fix again / have we converged" (engine uses actionable) and "the instructions fed to the agent"
// (buildAutoFixMessage uses actionableFindings) both rely on this definition, so it lives here in reviewFindingStats to keep the
// two from drifting apart. db/schema are injected by the caller (core does not depend on the runtime db directly).
